### Build and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/echtzeit-solutions/monsgeek-akko-linux.git
cd monsgeek-akko-linux

# Build and install driver + udev rules + device database
make driver
sudo make install
```

`make install` also installs the device database (key matrices, names, LED maps) and
offers to refresh it from the vendor driver first (default Yes) so newly-released models
are picked up; it falls back to the committed database if you decline, are offline, or
lack the extractor tools. To install the committed database without prompting:
`sudo make install SKIP_REFRESH=1`.

Then unplug and replug your keyboard.

Run `make help` to see all available targets:

```
Build targets (run as regular user):
  driver       Build driver release binary (default)
  driver-debug Build driver debug binary
  bpf          Build BPF loader
  bpf-ebpf     Build BPF eBPF program (requires nightly)
  test         Run tests
  check        Run clippy lints
  fmt          Format code
  clean        Clean all build artifacts

Install targets (run with sudo, after building):
  install         Install driver + udev rules
  install-all     Install everything (driver + BPF + systemd)
  install-driver  Install driver binary only
  install-udev    Install udev rules only
  install-bpf     Install BPF loader
  install-systemd Install systemd service for BPF auto-load
  uninstall       Remove all installed files
```

**Optional Cargo features:**

| Feature | Description | Extra Dependencies |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| `firmware-api` | Download firmware from cloud (default) | None |
| `screen-capture` | Screen color sync via PipeWire | `pipewire`, `clang` |

To build with optional features:
```bash
cd iot_driver_linux
cargo build --release --features "firmware-api,screen-capture"
```

### HID-BPF Battery Support (Kernel 6.12+)

The `akko-loader` BPF program exposes wireless keyboard battery level to the Linux power subsystem. **Requires kernel 6.12 or newer** due to HID-BPF struct_ops verifier requirements.

![KDE Power and Battery showing MonsGeek keyboard at 88%](docs/kde-power-menu.png)

**Prerequisites:**

```bash
# Check kernel version (must be 6.12+)
uname -r

# Install nightly Rust and bpf-linker (one-time setup)
rustup install nightly
cargo install bpf-linker
```

**Build and install:**

```bash
# Build driver and BPF loader first (as regular user)
make driver
make bpf

# Install driver, BPF loader, and systemd service (as root)
sudo make install-all

# Or install BPF components separately:
sudo make install-bpf      # Install akko-loader + BPF program
sudo make install-systemd  # Install systemd service for auto-load
```

**Manual usage:**

```bash
# Check status
akko-loader

# Load BPF (requires root)
sudo akko-loader load

# Check battery
cat /sys/class/power_supply/hid-*/capacity

# Unload BPF
sudo akko-loader unload
```

The BPF program pins to `/sys/fs/bpf/akko` and persists until unloaded.

**Known limitations:**

- **Charging status not available**: The stock HID protocol does not expose charging status. The power supply will always show "Discharging". Only battery percentage is available. For charging status support, see the [firmware patch](docs/FIRMWARE_PATCH.md) which adds native HID battery with charge detection.

**Automatic loading with udev/systemd:**

For automatic battery support when the keyboard connects, install the systemd service (included in `make install-all` or separately via `make install-systemd`).

How it works:
- When the keyboard connects, udev detects the device (VID:3151 PID:5038)
- udev triggers `akko-bpf-battery.service` via `SYSTEMD_WANTS`
- The service runs `akko-loader load` to attach the BPF program
- Battery level appears in `/sys/class/power_supply/` and desktop battery monitors
- When the keyboard disconnects, udev stops the service which runs `akko-loader unload`

Check service status:
```bash
systemctl status akko-bpf-battery.service
```

## Usage

### CLI Overview

For the complete command reference, see [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md).

**Launcher:** `sudo make install` also installs an `akko` command (run
`./akko.sh` from a checkout) that wraps the common workflows — `akko setup`,
`akko status`, `akko web` (official webapp), `akko tui`, `akko stop`. Anything
else passes straight through to `iot_driver`, so `akko triggers` ==
`iot_driver triggers`.

**Global debugging flags** (work with any command):
- `--monitor` - Trace all HID commands/responses
- `--file <pcap>` - Replay pcap capture file
- `--hex` - Show raw hex dumps
- `--filter <f>` - Filter packets (`all`, `events`, `commands`, `cmd=0xNN`)

**Common commands:**
```bash
iot_driver info              # Device ID and firmware
iot_driver led               # LED settings
iot_driver set-led wave 4 3  # Set LED mode
iot_driver triggers          # Show trigger settings
iot_driver set-rt on 0.3     # Enable Rapid Trigger
iot_driver tui               # Interactive TUI
iot_driver serve             # Start gRPC server
```

See [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md) for all 60+ commands including remapping, macros, animations, audio reactive, and firmware tools.

### Interactive TUI

Launch the terminal user interface for interactive control:

```bash
iot_driver tui
```

<video src="iot_driver_linux/tui-demo.webm" controls width="100%"></video>

**TUI Features:**
- Tab navigation between Device Info, LED Settings, Key Depth, Triggers, Options, Macros
- Real-time key depth visualization (bar chart and time series)
- Visual keyboard layout for per-key trigger settings
- Arrow keys to adjust values, Enter to confirm

**Key Depth Tab:**
- `v` - Toggle between bar chart and time series view
- `Space` - Select key for time series tracking
- `x` - Clear depth history

**Triggers Tab:**
- `v` - Toggle between list and keyboard layout view
- Arrow keys - Navigate keys in layout view
- `n/t/d/s` - Set mode (Normal/RT/DKS/SnapTap) for selected key
- `N/T/D/S` - Set mode for ALL keys

### Web App (app.monsgeek.com)

The driver includes a gRPC server that's compatible with the official MonsGeek web configurator.

**Start the server:**
```bash
iot_driver serve
```

The server runs on `127.0.0.1:3814` with gRPC-Web support.

**Connect from web app:**

1. Start the driver server: `iot_driver serve`
2. Open https://app.monsgeek.com in your browser
3. The web app will detect and connect to your keyboard
4. Use the full web UI for configuration

**Note:** The web app expects the server at localhost:3814. All keyboard features are accessible through the web interface including:
- LED mode selection and color picker
- Per-key RGB customization
- Trigger/actuation settings
- Key remapping
- Macro editor
- Firmware updates (use with caution)

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied
Make sure udev rules are installed and you've re-plugged the keyboard.

### Device Not Found
```bash
iot_driver list  # Check if device is visible
lsusb | grep 3151  # Verify USB connection
```

### TUI Not Starting
The TUI requires a proper terminal. It won't work in background mode or without a TTY.

### Web App Not Connecting
1. Ensure server is running: `iot_driver serve`
2. Check firewall isn't blocking port 3814
3. Verify with: `curl -v http://127.0.0.1:3814`

## Firmware Patches

See [docs/FIRMWARE_PATCH.md](docs/FIRMWARE_PATCH.md) for the custom firmware patches that add:

- **Battery over USB HID** — Native power_supply integration (no BPF needed), with charging status
- **LED streaming** — Per-key RGB control for GIF animations at ~30fps
- **Patch discovery** — 0xFB vendor command for capability detection

Patches are available for both the keyboard and the 2.4GHz wireless dongle. Stock firmware features are fully preserved. The doc also covers the [eBPF alternative](docs/FIRMWARE_PATCH.md#comparison-firmware-patch-vs-ebpf) for battery without flashing.
